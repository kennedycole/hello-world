Hey everyone!

This isn't really anything. I'm new to GitHub so I'm just exploring and trying things out.

Side Note: Bananas are amazing. 
If you're ever feeling nausous or need something quick to eat before a workout, grab a banana and some water.
They magically give you instant energy (like Popeye after eating spinach).
